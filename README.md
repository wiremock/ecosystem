# WireMock Ecosystem and Landscape

WireMock is 10+ years old, and it has a lot of various implementations, extensions! 
There are also various training, consulting and commercial offerings on the top of WireMock available.
In this repository, we try to somehow organize them and help others to discover all the projects:

- Overviews of existing WireMock integrations, extensions and implementations, open source or not
- Feature requests for **new** all things WireMock ecosystem items. Use existing repositories to address the existing ones 
- Requests for moving the components to WireMock GitHub organization and making them a part of the community governance
